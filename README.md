# ESP32 Stepper Motor Control Project

### Project Overview
The ESP32 Stepper Motor Control project demonstrates how to control a stepper motor using an ESP32 microcontroller. Stepper motors are precise and widely used in applications requiring controlled and repeatable movements, such as robotics, CNC machines, and 3D printers.

### Components Needed
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Controls the stepper motor and executes motor control logic.
- **Stepper Motor**: Converts electrical pulses into precise mechanical movements.
- **Stepper Motor Driver Module**: Translates control signals from the ESP32 into stepper motor movements.
- **Jumper Wires**: Connect the components together.
- **Power Supply**: Provides appropriate voltage and current to the motor and driver.

### Block Diagram

### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Stepper Motor to ESP32:**
   - **STEP Pin (stepPin)**: Connect to the STEP input of the stepper motor driver module.
   - **DIR Pin (dirPin)**: Connect to the DIR input of the stepper motor driver module.
   - **Power Supply**: Ensure the motor driver and stepper motor are powered according to their specifications.

### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize Serial communication using `Serial.begin(9600)` for debugging purposes.
   - Configure `stepPin` and `dirPin` as output pins using `pinMode()`.

2. **Operation:**
   - **Rotating the Stepper Motor:**
     - Use functions `rotateClockwise(steps)` and `rotateCounterclockwise(steps)` to control the motor direction.
     - Adjust the `stepsPerRevolution` variable to match your stepper motor's specifications (number of steps for a full revolution).

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Speed Control:** Adjust the `delayMicroseconds()` within the `rotateClockwise()` and `rotateCounterclockwise()` functions to control motor speed.
   - **Power Requirements:** Ensure the power supply can provide sufficient current for both the ESP32 and the stepper motor.

### Applications
- **Precision Positioning:** Used in CNC machines and 3D printers for precise movement.
- **Robotics:** Control joints and limbs of robotic systems.
- **Automated Systems:** Implement in automation projects requiring controlled movement.
